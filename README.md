# Generative Representation Learning with Deep Abelian Actions

- [x] Baseline Encoder, Action genertation done, with simple action loss of a(g_a g_b^-1, b) , g_a
- [x] Commutative loss, Abelian + Commutative loss
- [x] Exp with various encoders (Currently vgg19, which might be good enough)
- [x] Exp with various decoders (Currently only Add, Scale, Warp network. Try UNnet-like structures)
- [ ] Unconditional Sampling with prototypical face ?
- [ ] Compare results, make tables, transitions
- [ ] Interface-gan-ish analysis
